# JAVASCRIPT FUNDAMENTALS 1

## 1. Introduction to JavaScript

### What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
  - High-level: Easy for people to understand and write. (no worry about complex stuff)
  - Object-oriented: Based on objects. (build objects and they interact together)
  - Multi-paradigm: Can use different styles of programming.
  - Programming language: Instruct computer to do things.

### The Role of JavaScript in Web Deveopment

- HTML: Content
- CSS: Presentation
- JavaScript: Programming language: building web applications

## 3. Values and Variables

Naming convention

- Camel case
- Only contains numbers, letters, underscores, or dollar sign
- No reserved words (already used in syntax)
- Constant one uses uppercase
- Descriptive

## 3. Data Types

### 1. Objects and Primitives

- Value
  - Object
  - Primitive (everything else)

### 2. The 7 Primitive Data Types

1. Number: Floating point numbers: used for decimals and integers
2. String: Sequence of characters: used for text
3. Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or false: used for taking decisions
4. Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined(empty value)
5. Null: Also means empty value.
6. Symbol: Value that is unique and cannot be changed.
7. BigInt: Larger integers than the Number type can hold.

- JavaScript has dynamic typing: We do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are determined automatically.

```javascript
typeof
```

### 5. let, const and var

- let: mutable variable
- const: immutable variable (by default)
- var: like let, but no use more

### 6. Basic Operators

- Math operators

```javascript
2 ** 3; // 2 to the power of 3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
```

- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators

### 7. Operator Precedence

## Terms

- value: 값
- variable: 변수
- declare: 선언하다
- assign A to B: (변수에) 값을 할당하다
- decimals: 소수
- integers: 정수
- execute: 실행하다
- mutate: 바꾸다
- operator precedence: 연산자 우선순위
