# What is React?

_React is a JavaScript library for building User interfaces._

<br>

## 2. Why React?

JavaScript is not a great option.

- cumbersome
- error-prone
- hard to maintain
- not a simpler _mental model_

<br>

## 3. Declarative vs Imperative

- Declarative: define the target, not the steps — _React_
- Imperative: define the steps, not the goal — _JavaScript_<br>

Therefore, React will figure out and perform the necessary steps.<br><br>

## 4. Start command

- Install the dependeicies for the project

```command
npm install
```

- Start the development server

```command
npm start
```

<br>

## 5. What are components?

React makes building **complex**, **interactive** and **reactive** user interfaces **simpler**. All user interfaces in the end are made up of **components**.

<br>

## W6. hy components?

- Reusability
- Separation of concerns

Split big chunks of code into multiple smaller functions.
