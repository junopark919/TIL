# What is React?

_React is a JavaScript library for building User interfaces._<br><br>

## Why React?

JavaScript is not a great option.

- cumbersome
- error-prone
- hard to maintain
- not a simpler _mental model_
  <br><br>

## Declarative vs Imperative

- Declarative: define the target, not the steps — _React_
- Imperative: define the steps, not the goal — _JavaScript_<br>

Therefore, React will figure out and perform the necessary steps.<br><br>

## Start command

- Install the dependeicies for the project

```command
npm install
```

- Start the development server

```command
npm start
```

# What are components?

React makes building **complex**, **interactive** and **reactive** user interfaces **simpler**. All user interfaces in the end are made up of **components**.<br><br>

## Why components?

- reusability
- separation of concerns<br>

Split big chucks of code into multiple smaller functions<br><br>
